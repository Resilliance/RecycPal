### History Tab

The purpose of this tab is to let the user see the pictures they have taken in the past. At the top of this tab will be a cell that leads to finding the nearest recycling center for easy access to this important feature. 

Each cell in this section will lead to a previously taken picture by the user and will be labeled with the date the user took the picture. 

### Camera Tab

The purpose of this tab is to take a picture of the user's surroundings to identify any recyclable objects in the frame. Each picture will be automatically saved into the user's history.

After the user takes a picture, the application will perform some machine learning algorithms in the backend to identify any objects in the picture. The user will then see the object highlighted and labeled within the picture. 

Afterwards, the user has the option to take another picture. 

### Information Tab

The purpose of this tab is to provide the user information on the nearest recycling centers and the best recycling practices based on the materials.

In this case, we have paper, plastic, and metal materials. We will also include non-recyclables and how to deal with them.
